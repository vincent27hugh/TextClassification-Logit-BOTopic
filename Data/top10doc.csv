This dress is adorable. dress it up or dress it down,,,
This is awesome multi-season dress.,,,
I love the swing and the pretty color of the dress. it's fun to dress up or dress down. the fabric is a little thin so you will need good undergarments if you have lumps and bumps.,,,
Horrible fit. i do not understand why they but a aline dress with a skin non aline camisole under the dress.,,,
This dress is a good casual summer dress. the material is thin and feels nice on. the dress was very wrinkled when it arrived but that came out very easily and the fabric doesn't really wrinkle easily after initial wash and steam. the color is very vibrant and the fit is loose. however, if you have a larger chest (i'm a 34c), the hook and eye closure dones come undone. overall a good purchase. it looks good with a belt as well.,
Good quality; casual feel good dress. it can be worn as dress, or as tunic over the pants.,,
I love this dress . \r\nperfect fit and very good quality.,,,
As the previous reviewer mentioned,,,
I fist saw this dress in the window in alexandria, the pockets ruin this dress. pockets, usually such a good idea! but here they're misplaced (right on the hips) and made of the same thick ponte fabric as the dress, so they stand out far from the body and completely ruin the line of the dress... not flattering to have huge gaping hip pockets. this makes an otherwise good dress a total loss.
Really cute stress! i love the pattern and feel that this dress you can easily dress up or dress down. the neckline is the main reason why i bought the dress. it is a dress that hits above my knees so i like how modest it is. the slightly open back is also a nice touch. it's a dress that can easily be dressed up or dressed down. perfect spring dress!, va olde towne and i immediately said that i have to have it. upon receiving it in the mail, i was surprised by the quality of the dress. this dress is made very well. after trying it on it did look like i was going to be dancing with the hippies in woodstock. but i love the dress and plan on wearing it soon. good quality,
