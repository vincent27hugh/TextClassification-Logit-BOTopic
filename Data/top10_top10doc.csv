3,14947,0.69364554,I love the swing and the pretty color of the dress. it's fun to dress up or dress down. the fabric is a little thin so you will need good undergarments if you have lumps and bumps.

5,6295,0.6826043,This dress is a good casual summer dress. the material is thin and feels nice on. the dress was very wrinkled when it arrived but that came out very easily and the fabric doesn't really wrinkle easily after initial wash and steam. the color is very vibrant and the fit is loose. however

10,12380,0.6408222,Really cute stress! i love the pattern and feel that this dress you can easily dress up or dress down. the neckline is the main reason why i bought the dress. it is a dress that hits above my knees so i like how modest it is. the slightly open back is also a nice touch. it's a dress that can easily be dressed up or dressed down. perfect spring dress!
